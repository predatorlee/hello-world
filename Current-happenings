Today I am studying to become an ethical hacker.  I want to work in this field because I believe in integrity and doing the right thing.  
There is a high demand for Ethical Hackers.  Google and Facebook uses the same hacker.  That's one brain split in two.  
I want to be able to find the bad guys and protect people's information.
I am learning on LinkedIn Learning - Become an Ethical Hacker.  These courses are available on Lynda.com, a branch of LinkedIn Learning. 
I want to also write.  Maybe just blog posts but in the next 5 years, articles on Information Security.
